# OOAD
# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
#
# Object-oriented programming is a computer programming model that organizes
# software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
# An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
#
# OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the
# logic required to manipulate them.  This is well suited for large, complex and
# actively updated or maintained software.
#
# Additional benefits of OOP include reusability, scalability and efficiency.
